`Feature` or `featureset` is a string literal that can be used to change the functionality of the chart. There are simple (atomic) and complex (composite) features. Composite feature consists of simple features. Disabling composite feature disables all of its simple parts as well. Supported features are listed below.

Please note that the leading `-` characters are not part of the featureset name in the table below.
