You may specify Charting library widget parameters when calling its constructor. Here is an example of a call.

```javascript
new TradingView.widget({
    symbol: 'A',
    interval: 'D',
    timezone: "America/New_York",
    container_id: "tv_chart_container",
    locale: "ru",
    datafeed: new Datafeeds.UDFCompatibleDatafeed("https://demo_feed.tradingview.com")
});
```

Below is a complete list of supported parameters. Note that you can't change the parameters once the Charting Library is created. Use [Widget methods](Widget-Methods) if you wish to modify the parameters after the creation of the Charting Library.

### symbol, interval

The default symbol & time interval of your chart. The `interval` value is described in the [Section](Resolution). *Mandatory*

### timeframe

Sets the default timeframe of the chart. Timeframe is a period of bars that will be loaded and shown on the screen.
Valid timeframe is a number with a letter D for days and M for months.

### container_id

`id` is an attribute of a DOM element that you wish to include in the widget. *Mandatory*

### datafeed

JavaScript object that implements the ([JS API](JS-Api)) interface to supply the chart with data. *Mandatory*

### timezone

Default timezone of the chart. The time on the timescale is displayed according to this timezone.
See the [list of supported timezones](Symbology#timezone) for available values. Set it to `exchange` to use the exchange timezone. Use the [overrides](#overrides) section if you wish to override the default value.

### debug

Setting this property to `true` will make the chart write detailed API logs into the browser console. Alternatively, you can use the `charting_library_debug_mode` featureset to enable it.

### library_path

A path to a `static` folder.

### width, height

The desired size of a widget. Please make sure that there is enough space for the widget to be displayed correctly.

**Remark**: If you want the chart to use all the available space use the `fullscreen` parameter instead of setting it to '100%'.

### fullscreen

*Default:* `false`

Boolean value showing whether the chart should use all the available space in the window.

### autosize

*Default:* `false`

Boolean value showing whether the chart should use all the available space in the container and resize when the container itself is resized.

### symbol_search_request_delay

A threshold delay in milliseconds that is used to reduce the number of symbol search requests when the user is typing a name of a symbol in the search box.

### auto_save_delay

A threshold delay in seconds that is used to reduce the number of `onAutoSaveNeeded` calls.

### toolbar_bg

Background color of the toolbars.

### study_count_limit

*Starting from version 1.5.*

Maximum amount of studies on the chart of a multichart layout. Minimum value is 2.

### studies_access

*Starting from version 1.1.*

An object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    type: "black" | "white",
    tools: [
        {
            name: "<study name>",
            grayed: true
        },
        < ... >
    ]
}
```

* `type` is the list type. Supported values are: `black` (all listed items should be disabled), `white` (only the listed items should be enabled).
* `tools` is an array of objects. Each object could have the following properties:
  * `name` (*Mandatory*) is the name of a study. Use the same names as in the pop-ups of indicators.
  * `grayed` is a boolean showing whether this study should be visible but look as if it's disabled. If the study is grayed out and user clicks it, then the `onGrayedObjectClicked` function is called.

### drawings_access

*Starting from version 1.1.*

This property has the same structure as the `studies_access`argument that is described above. Use the same names as you see in the UI.

**Remark**: There is a special case for font-based drawings. Use the "Font Icons" name for them. Those drawings cannot be enabled or disabled separately - the entire group will have to be either enabled or disabled.

### saved_data

JS object containing saved chart content. Use this parameter when creating the widget if you have a saved chart already. If you want to load the chart content when the chart is initialized then use [load() method](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/wiki/Widget-Methods#loadstate) of the widget.

### locale

Locale to be used by Charting Library. See [Localization](Localization) section for details.

Example: `numeric_formatting: { decimal_sign: "," }`

### customFormatters

It is an object that contains the following fields:

1. timeFormatter
1. dateFormatter

You can use these formatters to adjust the display format of the date and time values.
Both values are objects that include functions such as `format` and `formatLocal`:

```javascript
function format(date)
function formatLocal(date)
```

These functions should return the text that specifies date or time. `formatLocal` should convert date and time to local timezone.

Example:

```javascript
customFormatters: {
  timeFormatter: {
    format: function(date) { var _format_str = '%h:%m'; return _format_str.replace('%h', date.getUTCHours(), 2). replace('%m', date.getUTCMinutes(), 2). replace('%s', date.getUTCSeconds(), 2); }
  },
  dateFormatter: {
    format: function(date) { return date.getUTCFullYear() + '/' + date.getUTCMonth() + '/' + date.getUTCDate(); }
  }
}
```

### overrides

The object that contains new values for default widget properties.
You can override most of the Charting Library properties (which also may be edited by user through UI) using `overrides` parameter of Widget constructor. `overrides` is supposed to be an object. The keys of this object are the names of overridden properties. The values of these keys are the new values of the properties. Example:

```javascript
overrides: {
    "symbolWatermarkProperties.color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"
}
```

This code will make the watermark 100% opaque (invisible). All customizable properties are listed in [separate article](Overrides). You can use [Drawings-Overrides](Drawings-Overrides) starting from v 1.5.

### disabled_features, enabled_features

The array containing names of features that should be enabled/disabled by default. `Feature` means part of the functionality of the chart (part of the UI/UX). Supported features are listed [here](Featuresets).

Example:

```javascript
TradingView.onready(function()
{
    var widget = new TradingView.widget({
        /* .... */
        disabled_features: ["header_widget", "left_toolbar"],
        enabled_features: ["move_logo_to_main_pane"]
    });
});
```

### snapshot_url

This URL is used to send a POST request with base64-encoded chart snapshots when a user presses the snapshot button. This endpoint should return the full URL of the saved image in the the response.

### indicators_file_name

Path to the file that contains your compiled indicators. See more details [here](Creating-Custom-Studies).

### preset

`preset` is a name of predefined widget settings. For now, the only value supported in the `preset` is  `mobile`. The example of this `preset` is [available here](https://demo_chart.tradingview.com/mobile_black.html).

### studies_overrides

Use this option to customize the style or inputs of the indicators. You can also customize the styles and inputs of the `Compare` series using this argument. See more details [here](Studies-Overrides)

### time_frames

List of visible timeframes that can be selected at the bottom of the chart.

Example:

```javascript
time_frames: [
    { text: "50y", resolution: "6M", description: "50 Years" },
    { text: "3y", resolution: "W", description: "3 Years", title: "3yr" },
    { text: "8m", resolution: "D", description: "8 Month" },
    { text: "3d", resolution: "5", description: "3 Days" },
    { text: "1000y", resolution: "W", description: "All", title: "All" },
]
```

Timeframe is an object containing the `text` and `resolution` properties. The `text` property should have the following format: `<integer><y|m|d>` ( \d+(y|m|d) as Regex ). Resolution is a string and its format is described here - [here](Resolution). See [this topic](Time-Frames) to learn more about timeframes.

The `description` property was added in v 1.7 and is displayed in the pop-up menu. This parameter is optional. If it isn't specified then the `title` or `text` property is used as a description.

The `title` property was added in v 1.9 and its value will override the default title generated based on the `text` property. This parameter is optional.

### charts_storage_url, client_id, user_id

These arguments are related to the high-level API for saving/loading the charts. See more details [here](Saving-and-Loading-Charts).

### charts_storage_api_version

A version of your backend. Supported values are: `"1.0"` | `"1.1"`. Study Templates are supported starting from version `"1.1"`.

### load_last_chart

Set this parameter to `true` if you want the library to load the last saved chart for a user (you should implement [save/load](Saving-and-Loading-Charts) first to make it work).

```

### favorites

Items that should be marked as favorite by default. This option requires that the usage of localstorage is disabled (see [featuresets](Featuresets) to know more). The `favorites` property is supposed to be an object. The following properties are supported:

* **intervals**: an array of time intervals that are marked as favorite. Example: `["D", "2D"]`
