Resolution or time interval is a time period of one bar. The Charting Library supports intraday resolutions (seconds, minutes, hours) and DWM resolutions (daily, weekly, monthly).
Charting Library API has lots of methods that accept and return resolutions.

## Intraday

### Seconds

Format: `xS`, where `x` is a number of seconds.

Example: `1S` - one second, `2S` - two seconds, `100S` - one hundred seconds.

### Minutes

Format: `x`, where `x` is a number of minutes.

Example: `1` - one minute, `2` - two minutes, `100` - one hundred minutes.

### Hours

**Important:** while user interface allows a user to enter a number of hours as `xh` or `xH`, it is never passed to the API. Hours are always set using minutes in the Charting Library API.

Example: `60` - one hour, `120` - two hours, `240` - four hours.

## DWM

### Days

Format: `xD`, where `x` is a number of days.

Example: `1D` - one day, `2D` - two days, `100D` - one hundred days.

### Weeks

Format: `xW`, where `x` is a number of weeks.

Example: `1W` - one week, `2W` - two weeks, `100W` - one hundred weeks.

### Months

Format: `xM`, where `x` is a number of months.

Example: `1M` - one month, `2M` - two months, `100M` - one hundred months.

### Years

Years are set using months.

Example: `12M` - one year, `24M` - two year, `48M` - four years.
